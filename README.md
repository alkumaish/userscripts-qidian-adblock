"It should allow you to bypass Qidian's forced video ads.

It keeps running all the time, so it should work even if new chapters are loaded on scrolling.

Once it detects an ad-wall, it blurs the text a bit while it's loading, and after a few seconds it should return to normal with the full content of the chapter.

This does not play any ads under the hood; the delay is because Qidian generates a "token" specific to that chapter but it takes a while to become active."
